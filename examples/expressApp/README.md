# Sample Express App

Example of checkout page using Midtrans Snap & Core Api. A quick and secure way to accept payment.

This is a very simple, very minimalist example to demonstrate integrating
Midtrans Snap with Express (Node JS). To start:

1. Install latest Node JS (Node v9 for instance, as used by this example) & npm
2. Clone the repository, open terminal in this `expressApp` folder.
3. Install dependencies `npm install`
4. Run the web server using:
	- `node app.js`, or
	- `npm start`

The app will run at port 3000.
Open `localhost:3000` from browser
